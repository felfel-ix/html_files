        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
            study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing and experimentation during the conceptualization, design, measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures.

        <h3>Is a Computer Science Degree Worth It?</h3>
        <p>Nearly every industry uses technology to conduct business, which means they require educated professionals who can develop software, design websites, and manage databases. This trend has contributed to the high demand of computer science degrees as well as their surge in popularity among college students. These days, majoring in computer science can open the door to an array of high-paying fields, such as software engineering, web development, information technology, and network systems administration.

            Is Computer Science Hard?
        </h3>
        <p>
            There is a belief that studying Computer Science is very difficult. The belief that Computer Science is one of the hardest fields to learn.  The answer to this question is “Yes.” Computer Science is a difficult field to study and learn for a number of reasons. There is an entire body of contemporary research dedicated to determining why this is the case, and two general conclusions have been reached:
        </p>
        <p>
            Students who are weak in mathematics tend to be weak in programming and therefore weak in Computer Science, and, Students tend to be unprepared for the constructive nature of the Computer Science discipline.
